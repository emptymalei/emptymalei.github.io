Valentina and Jebediah initiated the KCLRP, which is short for Kerbal Colonization Long Range Plan.

The goal is to build base on every planet and moon in the whole Kerbol system.

The idea came to Valentina when she landed at the south pole some years ago.

## Project Nomand

Project Nomand is the first project in aim of building a functional self-sustained extra-Kerbin base.


### Duna Base

Instead of being steady and cautious, Jebediah proposed to build the first Nomand base on Duna, and they did.

The base ships with a tiny rover, just in case someone wants to race against the Kerbol.

This Duna base also has a mining facility. But remember, this is not for profit. Kerbals never talk about profit.

### Lythe Base

The very next attempt was to build such a base on Lythe.

Bill Kerman was sent to Lythe first for a research of the landing sites for the base. However, Bill Kerman crashed his ship and couldn't come back. (Photos of Bill Kerman are missing here.)

What was unfortunate is that the first launch of Project Nomand to Lythe, i.e. the science and habitat module of the base was two far away from the expected site. The wheels were not strong enough to support a long trip.

### Minmus Base

After the not-so-successful try of Lythe base, they realized that a minmus base - at least a fuel base - was necessary.

## Project Zero

Project Zero was created as Project Collins by the famous Collins family.

## Project Asteroid City

Project Asteroid City was the first project that sucessfully brings back a asteroid and circularize it around Kerbin.

Jebediah, Bill, Bob, Valentina and Lizzy all took part in this fly but only Lizzy was willing to stay on the asteroid. Lizzy built a station uppon this small rock and also tested the first asteroid miner.

The project was not so smooth even with both Jeb and Val on the ship. It took them more than one year to bring back the rock.

As the asteroid started to steadily orbit around Kerbin, Lizzy requested the Launch of Asteroid City Ship, which then became one with the asteroid itself.

The first module built has only a nice habitat capsule and two large storage cans. This ship is complete automatically running on itself since the most advanced station AI has been implemented.

Then a science module and more storage were launched.

A mining ship was designed to test the technology involved in asteroid mining. The data shows the design was quite amazing.

The mining ship has four drills.

Lizzy loves the view, even with the mining machine running.
