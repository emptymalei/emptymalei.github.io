## Pacifier

**[Rainy Mood](http://www.rainymood.com/), [Coffitivity](http://coffitivity.com/) and [Noisli](http://www.noisli.com/) are the recommended ones.**

[Rainy Mood](http://www.rainymood.com/)(iOS & Android & Web): rainy day rainy mood, simple but with excellent white noise; a new beautiful soundtrack each day

[Coffitivity](http://coffitivity.com/)(iOS & Android & Web & Mac): a rather simple but ellite cafe library; premium has more three more soundtracks; elegant UI; scientific research powered

[Noisli](http://www.noisli.com/) (Web): free mixing of multiple tracks (which is similar to Soundrown but with much better UI). Users can save a customized setting for later use. I personally think this one has better fire sound tracks than soundrown.

[Soundrown](http://soundrown.com/)(Web, Apps Developers Hiring): free mixing of multiple tracks

[A Soft Murmur](http://asoftmurmur.com/)(Web): free mixing of multiple tracks; simple UI; Timer provided; Meander available

[mynoise](http://mynoise.net/noiseMachines.php)(iOS & Web): a noise generator; a lot of choices (too many actually); detailed equalizer

[Rainy Cafe](http://rainycafe.com/)(Web): not much to say just a combination of rainy mood and coffitivity

[Sleep Pillow](http://www.clearskyapps.com/portfolio/sleep)(iOS & Mac): click and play style preloaded scenes; easy to use; beautiful design
