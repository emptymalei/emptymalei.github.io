## Cloud Services


### Math/Programming

* Coding/Numerical Calculation/Analytical Derivation
 1. [Sagemath](https://cloud.sagemath.com/): LaTeX, R, iPython Notebook, etc.
 2. [PiCloud](http://picloud.com): python, but it's shutting down and aquired by Dropbox for a new site called [Multyvac](http://www.multyvac.com/).
 3. [Multyvac](https://www.multyvac.com/): sucessor of PiCloud.
 4. [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/): excellent engine with great AI; never to miss this one

* Search

### Plots

0. [plot.ly](https://plot.ly/): online plotting with many cloud services connected
1. [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator): excellent service
2. [graph.tk](http://graph.tk/): online plotting with rich features
3. [DataJoy](https://www.getdatajoy.com): developed by ShareLaTeX team; python & R at this moment

### Online Editors


#### LaTeX


1. [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/): Dropbox integration, preview, cooperation.
2. [WriteLaTeX](https://www.writelatex.com/)
3. [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/)


You can host one using your own machine,

1. [FlyLaTeX](https://github.com/alabid/flylatex): A free, open source version of sharelatex
2. [ShareLaTeX Source Code](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex): ShareLaTeX open sourced their codes. This is a great move I would say.


> There are other editors that is not fully LaTeX somehow partially support LaTeX.

> 1. [StackEdit](http://stackedit.io): Markdown + Math
> 2. [JaxEdit](http://jaxedit.com/): JaxEdit is not exactly an online LaTeX editor but anyway it uses mathjax to render math.

#### Markdown

1. [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/): Markdown and MathJax
2. [CMD markdown](https://www.zybuluo.com/mdeditor): Basically a Chinese copy of StackEdit
3. [Penflip](https://www.penflip.com/): Markdown based and git like.
4. [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/)
