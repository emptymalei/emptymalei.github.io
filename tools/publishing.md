## Publishing

First of all, we can make use of [GitHub](http://github.com) to cooperate with others.


### Markdown Again

* [Cloud Based Markdown Editors](Cloud-Services.html)
* [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) (Mac)
* [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) (Win): if you have no bad feelings about .NET
* [ReText](https://sourceforge.net/p/retext/home/ReText/) (All platforms | Open Source)


### The Documentation Generators

Make use of these softwares for publishing

1. [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org): RestructuredText as source, powerful, flexible.
2. [Gitbook](http://www.gitbook.io/): A new but promising tool for html, pdf etc.
3. [Git-scribe](https://github.com/schacon/git-scribe)
4. [Wordsmith](https://github.com/tractical/wordsmith)


#### Sphinx Themes and configurations

As an example, we'll demonstrate a little bit of the usage of Sphinx.

##### Themes

1. [rtd theme](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme)
2. [some beautiful themes](https://github.com/vkvn/sphinx-themes)
3. [bootstrap theme](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/): quite comfortable


##### Science Books Using Sphinx

1. [Theoretical Physics](https://github.com/certik/theoretical-physics)
2. [Statistical Physics](https://github.com/emptymalei/StatisticalPhysics)
3. [Physics Research Survival Manual](https://github.com/CosmologyTaskForce/PhysicsResearchSurvivalManual)



### Hosting

0. [ReadtheDocs](http://readthedocs.org/): Turn your restructuredtext source to html, pdf and epub, all done online.
1. Host source on [GitHub](http://github.com) or [some other git services](Be-Organized.html).
2. Deploy HTML on [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/) is the easy and beautiful way.

### Blog / CMS

Before doing the investigation on platforms, just remind yourself:

**I want to write, not run blogging software.**

#### Deploy And Go



#### Blog/CMS Softwares

These softwares are running on the server and can be

1. [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) (PHP): require a lot of maintance.
2. [Pico](https://github.com/gilbitron/Pico): lightweight cms, open source, no database.
3. [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost) (Node.js): Open, Simple, non-profit; write with markdown and live preview.


These Blog/CMS softwares can be hosted on the following servers.

1. [Dropplets](https://github.com/circa75/dropplets):Open source, simple, and elegant blog system; write in Markdonw.

#### Static Generator

[Here is a nice website](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) that tells you all the static site generators.

1. [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (Ruby): most widely used one I guess; easy to deply
2. [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) (Ruby): easier to use compared with jekyll; somewhat compatable with jekyll
3. [Hexo](https://github.com/tommy351/hexo) (Node.js)
4. [Peclican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/) (Python)
    * [Pelican Svbtle Theme](https://github.com/wting/pelican-svbtle)
5. [Nikola](http://getnikola.com/) (Python): multiple formats including restructuredtext; multiple purpose
6. [Tinkerer](http://tinkerer.me/index.html) (Python)
7. [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)(Go): easy to use and really fast
