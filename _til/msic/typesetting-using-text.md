summary: Some special characters to help with text typesetting
---

Use the symbol ▌ to help typesetting plain text file, especially on social media. One good example of this technique is

> ▌ This is a title
>
>
> xyz axis abc axis how is what is that is not cute smart

Heart is also a very useful symbol for lists in plain text.

>  ♥  ABC
>
>
>  ♥  CDE
