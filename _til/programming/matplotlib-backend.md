summary: Matplotlib provides many different backends
---


Among the many matplotlib backends, what I found is that `TkAgg` and `WebAgg` works well on a mac.

Backends could either be set in your bashrc/zshrc files using

```
MPLBACKEND = 
```

or a file located at `~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc` using

```
backend = 
```

A very useful customized backend is `itermplot` which displays plot result right in your iterm.
