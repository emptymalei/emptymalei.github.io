summary: Mathematica Plot might include some non-existant lines sometimes, Exclusions is the potion for it.

Mathematica Plot function brings in weird lines sometimes.

Here is an example of it. I plot

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{1-0.3 x}.
$$


```
Plot[1/(1 - 0.3 x), {x, 2, 5}, Frame -> True, 
 FrameLabel -> {"x", "1/(1-0.3 x)"}, ImageSize -> Large, 
 PlotLabel -> "Function: 1/(1-0.3 x)"]
```

What we get is a plot

This vertical line at $x=3$ is not real. To eliminate this line, we can exclude the singularity point when plotting, using `Exclusions`.

```
Plot[1/(x - 3), {x, 2, 4}, Frame -> True, 
 FrameLabel -> {"x", "1/(x-3)"}, ImageSize -> Large, 
 PlotLabel -> "Function: 1/(x-3)", Exclusions -> {3}]
```

The plot we get now is much better.
