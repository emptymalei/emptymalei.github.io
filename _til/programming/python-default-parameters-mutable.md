summary: Python default parameters might be changed with each run
---

As we might use default parameters in python functions, such as

```
def func(inp = []):
    inp.append(1)
    return inp
```

this might cause trouble. Since python functions are objects of a certain identity no matter how many times you run it, the input `inp` would be changed with each run.

The better strategy is to use `None`.


```
def func(inp = None):

    if inp is None:
       inp = []

    return inp
```
