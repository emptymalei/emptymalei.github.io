summary: Formatting numbers in python using format
---


`.format()` is a good way to format numbers. A good reference is [PyFormat](https://pyformat.info/).

For example, we can use scientific notation.

{% highlight python %}
print "{:e}".format(9887.2)
{% endhighlight %}

will give us

```
9.887200e+03
```

A quick and minimal version of what has been said is

1. ``{:04.2f}`` means make the total length of the number 4, with 2 significance digits and using 0's to fill up the other slots if the number is not long enough.
2. It's not necessary to put in all the specifications.
3. `d`, `f`, `e` can be used.
4. The signs can be speficied using `+`, e.g., ``{:+d}`.format(42)`.
