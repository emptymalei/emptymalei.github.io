summary: Several visualizations of the projects
---

I learned on [this webpage](https://www.officetimeline.com/project-management) that there are at least six different methods of visualization for a project. They are

1. Gantt chart, which tells us the overall time arrangement,
2. PERT chart, which tells us the overall plan by breaking down projects into small ones,
3. Pareto chart, which is the overall process of the project,
4. Work breakdown structure, which is what the name says,
5. Timeline,
6. Fishbone diagram, which lists all the possible factors that could have effect on the final results.
