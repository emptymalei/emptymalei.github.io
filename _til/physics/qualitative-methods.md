In order to do estimations, some relations should be remembered clearly.


1. Energy and temperature: $$\frac{1}{40}\mathrm{eV} = 300\mathrm{K} k_B .$$
2. Natural units: energy is related to length by $$ 1\mathrm{fm} = \frac{1}{197\mathrm{MeV}}.$$
3. For light, energy $$1\mathrm{eV}$$ corresponds to wavelength $$1.24\mathrm{\mu m}$$.
