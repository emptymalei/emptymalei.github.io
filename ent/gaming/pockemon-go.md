## Tools


* [pokemon go support @ NianticLabs](https://support.pokemongo.nianticlabs.com/hc/en-us): read about the basics of the gameplay
* [Map of pokemons locations: pokevision.com](https://pokevision.com/): pokemon locations, including despawn timer


## Catch A Pokemon

### Where to go

* Larger density of users -> more pokemons
* Higher trainer level -> larger CP
* Biome and time of day
  * [Pokemon Go: where to find all Pokemon types @ VG24/7](https://www.vg247.com/2016/07/15/pokemon-go-where-to-find-pokemon-types/): shows how to catch each type of pokemons


### Read the map

* Unit of distance: paws; 1 paw = 50 meters
* Start walking in a direction, then notice the number of paws. If paws decrease (after walking 50m), keep walking because this is the right direction. Otherwise go backwards.


### Pokeball

* Three types of balls: master ball; great ball; common pokeball
* Maximize the probability of catching:
  * The ring: green color > orange color > red color; minimize diameter of ring
  * The ball: master ball > great ball > common pokeball
  * Spin the ball
* Bonus XP: curve ball; nice throw; great throw.


## Items
