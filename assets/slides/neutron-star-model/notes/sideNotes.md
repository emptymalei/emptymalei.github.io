## Why GR and How

To find mass, integrate density over radius. Compact objects, GR scales distances.


## OV Equation

1. Three differential equations, 4 variables, need three IC, however two of which are given by physics. Only one free. p(0) or rho(0)
2. Mass function: not the newtonian way. gravitational energy is negative. mass curves later.


## IDEAL GAS

1. Mass ~ rho, given the density or pressure at the center the star is completely determined in simple models.
2. Mass starts from 0, becomes larger as density increases, then drops. Reason: gravitational binding energy is negative. Baryon rest mass energy increase is less than the gravitional binding energy starting from some density.
3. Mass starting from 0? Not possible because beta decay, neutron -> proton.

## npe gas and HW

1. Problem with OV: neutron occur at some density; Not all neutrons;
2. Actually we don't care much about min mass.

## Realistic Models

2. EoS. Just mention BJ and TNI for the figure
   * $\pi$: charged pion condensation
   * **R: Reid -> Reid soft core adapted to nuclear matter**
   * **BJ: Bethe Johnson -> Modified Reid soft core**
   * **TNI: Three-nucleon interaction, two and three nucleon interactions.**
   * TI: tensor interaction
   * MF: mean field, nuclear attraction due to scalar exchange.
1. Layers:
   * Stiffer, greater max mass;
   * Stiff EoS, lower central density, larger radius, thicker crust when compared with stars with soft EoS of the same mass.
2. Layers
  * Surface ($\rho\lt 10^6 g\cdot cm^{-3}$) 
  * -> Outer crust ($ 10^6 \lt \rho \lt 4.3 \times 10^{11}$) (coulomb lattice of heavy neuclei coesists in $\beta$ equilibrium with relativistic degenerate electron gas, just like **white dwarf**) 
  * -> Inner crust ($4.3\times 10^{11}\lt \rho \lt (2-2.4) 10^{14}$) (lattice of **neutron-rich neuclei** and **superfluid neutron** gas and normal **electron** gas) 
  * -> neutron liquid ($(2-2.4)\times 10^{14}\lt \rho \lt \rho_c$) 
  * -> **superfluid neutrons** and smaller concentration of superfluid protons and normal electrons.
3. Anyway, different equation of state gives us different layers.
3. Caption for the pasta image
   * Schematic slice through a neutron star. Letters N, n, p, e, Î¼ refer to the presence of nuclei, fluid neutrons and protons, electrons and muons, respectively. The inner core composition is still uncertain and various exotic possibilities exist, including hyperons and deconfined quark matter. 
   * Detailed picture of the composition of the inner crust. At lower densities, a lattice of superheavy, neutron-rich nuclei is immersed in a fluid of neutrons (which are likely to be superfluid) and a relativistic electron gas. **At high enough densities the nuclei might deform and connect along certain directions to form extended tubes, sheets and bubbles of nuclear matter**. These nuclear pasta phases might form a layer at the base of the neutron star crust, sometimes referred to as the mantle; searching for observational signatures of such phases is of great interest. Ranges of density and thickness given for each layer represent current uncertainties in the physics of neutron star crusts."
