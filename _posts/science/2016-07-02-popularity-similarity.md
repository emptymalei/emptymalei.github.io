## Questions

1. How about a degenerating network? As the nodes are destroyed one by one, the most connected nodes will be more important. We could also define a measure of importance. Another point of view is about the effect of removing a node. As a node is removed, which nodes are the most affected?
2. Why a polar coordinate system? What if I just use horizontal axis as similarity and vertial axis as popularity? (As in [^1] popularity is the emerging time.)



1. In real neuronal networks, evolution is done by removing nodes thus achieving some functional regions. How does removing nodes work, from the view of complex systems? Remove some people from the social network can also be interesting.


## MISC

Just some interesting points.

1. "If new connections are made pref-erentially to more popular nodes, then the resulting distribution ofthe number of connections possessed by nodes follows powerlaws" -- From *Popularity versus similarity in growing networks*
2. homophily: "Nodes that are similar have a higher chance of getting connected,even if they are not popular" -- From *Popularity versus similarity in growing networks*
