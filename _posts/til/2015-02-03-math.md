## Eigensystem of A Special Matrix

One of the most used matrix in physics is

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a + c \mathrm i & b \\
b & a + c \mathrm i
\end{pmatrix},
$$

where $a$, $b$, $c$ are real numbers.

It is interesting that as we go from

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a + c \mathrm i & 0 \\
0 & a + c \mathrm i
\end{pmatrix},
$$

to the previous matrix, the eigenstates change from

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0
\end{pmatrix},\qquad \mathrm{and } \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

to

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix},\qquad \mathrm{and } \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
-1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

no matter how small $b$ is.


**A useful trick when solving the eigensystem is to remove an identity from the matrix because it only shifts the eigenvalue by a certain amount.**


## Feynman trick

The following identity is true,

$$
\frac{1}{AB} = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{[A + (B - A) x ]^2} dx .
$$


## Area enclosed by a line

Area enclosed by a line is given by

$$
\vec S = \frac{1}{2}\int \vec x \times \vec{d l}.
$$

*Stop using stupid expressions.*


## Symmetry of second derivatives


[This wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_of_second_derivatives#Requirement_of_continuity) shows an example of symmetry breaking of the second derivatives, that is $\partial_x\partial_y f \ne \partial_y\partial_x f$. The example is

$$
f(x,y) = \begin{cases}
\frac{xy(x^2-y^2)}{x^2+y^2} & \mbox{ for } (x,y) \ne (0,0) \\
0 & \mbox{ for } (x,y) = (0,0).
 \end{cases}
$$

A image of the function is shown on wikipedia.
