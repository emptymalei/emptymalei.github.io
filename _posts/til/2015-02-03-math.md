## Feynman trick

The following identity is true,

$$
\frac{1}{AB} = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{[A + (B - A) x ]^2} dx .
$$


## Area enclosed by a line

Area enclosed by a line is given by

$$
\vec S = \frac{1}{2}\int \vec x \times \vec{d l}.
$$

*Stop using stupid expressions.*


## Symmetry of second derivatives


[This wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_of_second_derivatives#Requirement_of_continuity) shows an example of symmetry breaking of the second derivatives, that is $\partial_x\partial_y f \ne \partial_y\partial_x f$. The example is

$$
f(x,y) = \begin{cases}
\frac{xy(x^2-y^2)}{x^2+y^2} & \mbox{ for } (x,y) \ne (0,0) \\
0 & \mbox{ for } (x,y) = (0,0).
 \end{cases}
$$

A image of the function is shown on wikipedia.
