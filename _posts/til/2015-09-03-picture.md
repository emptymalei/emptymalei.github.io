## Qualitative Methods

In order to do estimations, some relations should be remembered clearly.


1. Energy and temperature: $$\frac{1}{40}\mathrm{eV} = 300\mathrm{K} k_B .$$
2. Natural units: energy is related to length by $$ 1\mathrm{fm} = \frac{1}{197\mathrm{MeV}}.$$
3. For light, energy $$1\mathrm{eV}$$ corresponds to wavelength $$1.24\mathrm{\mu m}$$.



## Quantities

1. Fine structure constant: $$\alpha = \frac{k_e e^2}{\hbar c} \propto e^2$$.
2. Bohr radius: $$a_0 = \frac{\hbar}{m_e c \alpha} $$.
3. Parallel capacitors:

## Important Processes

1. **Compton scattering:**
   1. The change in the wavelength of the electron is related to the de Broglie wavelength of the electron, $\lambda_e  = \frac{h}{m_e c}$.
   2. Zero scattering angle means no change in wavelength, since no recoil happens.
   3. Bouncing back gives the max change in wavelength of photons.
   4. The relation is $\lambda'-\lambda = \lambda_e (1 - \cos \theta)$, where $\theta$ is the scattering angle between photon incoming momentum and the outgoing momentum.



## Some Concepts

1. Semiconductors
   1. n-type: more electrons
   2. p-type: more hole concentrations
