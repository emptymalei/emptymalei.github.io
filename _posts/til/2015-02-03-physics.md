## Interesting Facts on Eigenstates

The eigenstates of a matrix

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
E_1 & 0 \\
0 & E_2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

are

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}, \qquad \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

However if we put in two real off-diagonal elements

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
E_1 & \epsilon \\
\epsilon & E_2
\end{pmatrix},
$$

the eigenstates becomes

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ -1
\end{pmatrix}, \qquad \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 1
\end{pmatrix}.
$$


If we are talking about real matrix,

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
E_1 & 0 \\
0 & E_2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

even though it is true that the eigenstates are

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}, \qquad \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix},
$$

the eigenstates are not that simple if we add in off-diagonal elements that make sure the matrix is still Hermitian.

In fact the eigenstates for the eigenequation

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
E_1 & \epsilon \\
\epsilon^* & E_2
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
a \\ b
\end{pmatrix} = \lambda \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b  \end{pmatrix},
$$

is given by

$$
(E_1-E_2) a b + \epsilon b^2 - \epsilon^* a^2 = 0,
$$

where $b^2 = b \cdot b$ is not the modulus squared.








## Sound of A Star

Through experiment on dense and hot plasma, Ravindra Kumar and others are capable of finding acoustic waves of terahertz in the plasma. Since the stars has similar plasma condition, this kind of acoustic waves can appear in a star.

## Quantum Radar and Quantum Illuminating

Two entangled beams are split into two with one of them shooting at the object. As long as the reflected beam is collected, it is compared with the other beam which has been keeped original. Quantum correlation make it easier to identify the real reflected beam from noisy background. This is the scheme of quantum illuminating in optics which could be extended to other waveband such as radar band. [^quantumRadar]

This could be possibly used to MRI and other similar areas.

## The Yarkovsky Effect and YORP Effect


Yarkovsky Efffect[^yarkovsky]: Asteroids obsorbs sunlight, heated up by the light and emmits thermal radiation. The thermal radiations can produce a tiny force but accumulated through decades to change the orbit of asteroids of size less than 30 - 40 km.

YORP Effect[^yarkovsky]: Similarly the reflection of sunlight and thermal radiation can cause a torque on the small objects.
