## The Yarkovsky Effect and YORP Effect


Yarkovsky Efffect[^yarkovsky]: Asteroids obsorbs sunlight, heated up by the light and emmits thermal radiation. The thermal radiations can produce a tiny force but accumulated through decades to change the orbit of asteroids of size less than 30 - 40 km.

YORP Effect[^yarkovsky]: Similarly the reflection of sunlight and thermal radiation can cause a torque on the small objects.
