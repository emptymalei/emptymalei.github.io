## Quantum Radar and Quantum Illuminating

Two entangled beams are split into two with one of them shooting at the object. As long as the reflected beam is collected, it is compared with the other beam which has been keeped original. Quantum correlation make it easier to identify the real reflected beam from noisy background. This is the scheme of quantum illuminating in optics which could be extended to other waveband such as radar band. [^quantumRadar]

This could be possibly used to MRI and other similar areas.

## The Yarkovsky Effect and YORP Effect


Yarkovsky Efffect[^yarkovsky]: Asteroids obsorbs sunlight, heated up by the light and emmits thermal radiation. The thermal radiations can produce a tiny force but accumulated through decades to change the orbit of asteroids of size less than 30 - 40 km.

YORP Effect[^yarkovsky]: Similarly the reflection of sunlight and thermal radiation can cause a torque on the small objects.
