## Earth Has Quasi-satellites.

Moon is not the only companion of Earth. [3753 Cruithne](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6634/full/387651a0.html), for example, is on a quasi-satellite orbit of Earth. It orbits the sun but seen from earth the orbit is a bean like shape upon Earth.

## Alkaline Ocean on Enceladus

The ocean of Enceladus could have a ocean composed of Na-Cl-CO3, which is alkaline. This analysis is done using observational data from Cassini spacecraft. [^enceladus]
