## Connectome

Connectome is complete map of a neural system. In history, the connectome of nematode was built completely.([^connect1] and [^connect2])

There is an excellant TED talk given by Sebastian Seung, [I am my connectome](http://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_seung#t-1135647). This is an intriguing talk. And I started thinking a lot about this idea.

## Simple English

If you simplify your English, when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself. 

This is by George Orwell.

## Typesetting In Text

Use the symbol ▌ to help typesetting plain text file, especially on social media. One good example of this technique is

> ▌ This is a title
> 
> 
> xyz axis abc axis how is what is that is not cute smart

Heart is also a very useful symbol for lists in plain text.

>  ♥  ABC
>
>
>  ♥  CDE
